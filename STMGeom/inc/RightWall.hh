// The right wall of the STM shield house: the wall on the +x side, 
// running downstream from the front shielding.
//
// Five layers worked inward along -x from one reference vertex -- an
// outer poly pair, a lead layer, an inner poly pair, a second lead
// layer, and a copper sheet -- 26 pieces. Nothing here is bored.
//
// The lead layers are BrickWalls, as in the front shielding, with
// courses running along z and the layers stacking along -x.
//
// Every position arrives resolved from STMMaker. The wall is fixed by
// the reference vertex -- flush with the +z side of the front
// shielding's last lead layer, at that layer's +x, -y corner -- and by
// the baseplate, so each piece follows from butting against its
// neighbour rather than from a measurement of its own.
