  // eleven lead ones. Unlike the walls this is not a stack of layers --
  // every piece is placed on its own -- so there is no layer sequence,
  // just the three lists below.
  //
  // Some pieces are bored on the LaBr beam axis, naming the bores they
  // take by number as everything else in the house does. The bore
  // follows the collimator, so STMMaker resolves its center from
  // offset_Spot.

  // A prism swept along one axis, given in the ExtShieldDownstream
  // form: a u/v cap polygon plus a sweep length.
  //
  // Placed by an ANCHOR on its cap origin, since the outlines are
  // traced from the vertex nearest the section reference. The sweep is
  // centered on that point, as G4ExtrudedSolid centers an extrusion on
  // its placement point.
