// The floor of the STM shield house, including the steel baseplate the
// whole house stands on.
//
// Five layers worked upward in +y above the plate: a borated poly
// prism, a lead layer, the same prism again, a second lead layer, and
// two copper prisms. 46 pieces, none of them bored.
//
// Both lead layers are mostly columns, which a BrickWall describes, but
// each also carries a few bricks that break the column pattern. Those
// arrive already placed in the same BrickWall, since a BrickWallBrick
// holds its own centre and orientation -- the distinction between a
// column brick and a stray matters only in the config, where one is
// written as a list and the other as a tuple.
//
// Every position arrives resolved from STMMaker. The wall is fixed by
// one reference -- 5 in inboard of the house reference in x, at that
// reference's z, and at the TOP of the baseplate in y.
